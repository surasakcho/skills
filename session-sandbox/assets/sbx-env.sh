# sbx-env.sh — shared constants + the ISOLATION GUARD for the sandbox.
# Source this at the top of every sandbox script:  source "$(dirname "$0")/sbx-env.sh"
#
# SAFETY CONTRACT (why this file exists):
#   The whole point of the sandbox is to develop a session-continuity mechanism that
#   starts/kills/rotates Claude sessions WITHOUT any risk to real sessions (e.g. `ebiz`,
#   the operator's live session). The guarantee is enforced structurally here:
#     * every sandbox session/RC name MUST match ^sbx-[a-z0-9]+$
#     * sbx_assert_target REFUSES any name that is not sbx-* (real sessions can't match the prefix)
#     * a sbx-* session MAY target ITSELF — self-rotation (refresh) is the whole point; the prefix,
#       not a "== current" rule, is the load-bearing guard (a real session can never match sbx-*).
#   => a bug, a typo, or a bad env var can never resolve to a real session name.
#      There is deliberately NO code path that kills a session by pattern, by "all", or by
#      the current session. Only `sbx_kill <sbx-name>` exists, and it calls the guard first.
